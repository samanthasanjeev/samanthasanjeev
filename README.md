I’m a PharmD with a Master’s in Health Informatics, passionate about where healthcare meets tech. I love finding smarter, data-driven ways to improve patient care and make clinical workflows less chaotic. 
With a solid mix of clinical knowledge and tech know-how, I’m all about creating thoughtful, real-world solutions that actually make a difference in how care is delivered. 
Always curious, always learning—especially when it means pushing healthcare forward in meaningful ways.
